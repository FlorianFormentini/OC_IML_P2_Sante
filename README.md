# OpenClassrooms IML - Project 2 : HealthCare App

The "Sant√© Publique France" agency is looking for innovative ideas for applications related to food.  
The objective of this project was therefore a study of the available data in order to propose a solution to improve the diet of its users.  

## Data
The dataset suggested in the call for projects is Open Fact Foods, available on its [official website](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/)  

A definition of each column can be found [here](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/data/data-fields.txt)

The data is separated into four sections:
- General information on the product sheet: name, date of modification, etc.
- A set of tags: product category, location, origin, etc.
- The ingredients of the products and their possible additives.
- Nutritional information: amount in grams of a nutrient per 100 grams of the product

## Missions
1. Process the dataset in order to identify relevant variables for future processing. Automate these treatments to avoid repeating these operations
2. Perform an univariate analysis for each variable of interest, in order to synthesize its behavior.
3. Perform at least one multivariate analysis and the appropriate statistical tests to verify the significance of the results.
4. Find an application idea related to food and write an exploration report.
